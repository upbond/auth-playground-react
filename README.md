# React/JavaScript: Basic User Authentication Code Sample

This JavaScript code sample demonstrates **how to implement user authentication** in React applications using Auth0. This React code sample builds the Single-Page Application (SPA) using the React Router 6 library.

This code sample is part of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources), a place where you can explore the authentication and authorization features of the Auth0 Identity Platform.

Visit the ["React/JavaScript + React Router 6 Code Sample: User Authentication For Basic Apps"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/spa/react/basic-authentication) page for instructions on how to configure and run this code sample and how to integrate it with an API server of your choice to [create a full-stack code sample](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack/hello-world/basic-access-control/spa).
